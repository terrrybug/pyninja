# PyNinja Upload Instructions

## Package Status
âœ… **Import Error Fixed**: The `__description__` import error has been resolved
âœ… **Package Built**: Distribution files are ready in the `dist/` directory
âœ… **Testing Complete**: CLI functionality verified working

## Files Ready for Upload
- `dist/pyninja-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- `dist/pyninja-1.0.0.tar.gz`

## Upload Steps

### Option 1: Manual Upload via PyPI Web Interface
1. Go to https://pypi.org/account/register/ (if needed)
2. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/ and create an API token
3. Visit https://pypi.org/manage/projects/
4. Upload the files from the `dist/` directory

### Option 2: Command Line Upload (requires PyPI token)
```bash
# Set your PyPI token as environment variable
export TWINE_PASSWORD="your_pypi_api_token_here"
export TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Option 3: Test Upload to TestPyPI First (Recommended)
```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI first to verify
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# If successful, then upload to real PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## What Was Fixed
- Added missing `__description__` variable to `pyninja/__init__.py`
- Updated the installed package version in virtual environment
- Verified CLI commands work correctly (`pyninja --version`, `pyninja --help`)

## Post-Upload Verification
After uploading, you can verify the package works by:
```bash
pip install pyninja --upgrade
pyninja --version
```

The package is now error-free and ready for distribution! ðŸ¥·
